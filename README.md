## Introduction ðŸ“–

`lual-utils-youtube` is a library that was built for creating an article about developing a JavaScript package for publication on NPM. The article is in Portuguese and can be accessed at the following link:

[Artigo: Como criar um pacote JavaScript para o NPM
](https://blog.gzappy.com/blog/2024/07/como-criar-um-pacote-javascript-para-o-npm)

In this article, I cover step by step the process of building this package, from project creation to publishing on NPM. However, to make it more than just a theoretical article, I created this package with some utility functions that I use frequently in my daily life and that might be useful for you too.
